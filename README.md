# Cpp-programs
This repository will hold various beginner to intermediate level C++ programs that I developed.
I am new to software development and these are my first c++ projects.

Projects contained within:

1. Grade calculator: 
This project reads input and classifies the input grade by category and score. The actual grading mechanism is described within the source code and there are various other rules which are also described within grade_calculator.cpp

2. Boolean functions:
This project contains several functions that output truth tables for common logical operations when called from main. The final two functions compute the true/false value of a boolean expression given three inputs and display the result.
